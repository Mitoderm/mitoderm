    "item1": {
      "title": "What are exosomes, and why are they revolutionary in skin treatments?",
      "text": "Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles (60–150 nm) that act as biological messengers, transferring growth factors, proteins, and RNA from one cell to another. In aesthetic medicine, they “communicate” with skin cells, triggering processes of repair, renewal, and inflammation reduction—naturally and precisely. Since their clinical introduction in 2011, exosomes have transformed skin rejuvenation by promoting not just external improvements, but deep cellular activation."
    },
    "item2": {
      "title": "How do synthetic exosomes work compared to natural ones?",
      "text": "VM's synthetic exosomes are lab-engineered to mimic the biological effects of natural exosomes, but with significant advantages: controlled composition, greater stability, and reduced risk of irritation or immune response. They act as “smart carriers” for active ingredients such as biomimetic peptides and PDRN, allowing these actives to reach the target cells intact and exert maximal biological efficacy."
    },
    "item3": {
      "title": "Who are synthetic exosome treatments suitable for?",
      "text": "For anyone seeking skin regeneration, tissue repair, improved texture, wrinkle reduction, acne scar fading, pigmentation correction, and sun damage repair. These treatments are ideal for mature, thin, or damaged skin, as well as skin suffering from chronic low-grade inflammation. Exosomes can be combined with microneedling, RF, CO₂ laser, or other devices to accelerate healing and enhance clinical results."
    },
    "item4": {
      "title": "What makes V-Tech synthetic exosomes unique?",
      "text": "Each ampoule contains 20 billion synthetic exosomes, in a potent and targeted concentration. Combined with PDRN — organic DNA fragments that promote cell repair, collagen synthesis, and anti-inflammatory action. Enriched with biomimetic peptides, such as Acetyl Decapeptide-3 and Oligopeptide-20, which mimic the function of natural growth factors. Deliver active ingredients directly into target cells via controlled release—for rapid, focused, and efficient skin response. Developed under strict scientific supervision with a clinically tested protocol from Italy."
    },
    "item5": {
      "title": "What is the advantage of combining PDRN and biomimetic peptides inside exosomes?",
      "text": "This combination offers precise regenerative activity: PDRN promotes angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), DNA repair, and extracellular matrix (ECM) enhancement—improving skin elasticity, tone, and pigmentation. Biomimetic peptides mimic growth factors like FGF and Somatomedin, regulate collagen, elastin, and fibronectin production, and provide a natural lifting effect. By encapsulating them inside synthetic exosomes, the actives remain stable, reach their target precisely, and are absorbed several times more efficiently due to controlled, targeted delivery. What is unique about combining synthetic exosomes with PDRN? The combination of synthetic exosomes and PDRN is a scientific breakthrough in tissue regeneration: The synthetic exosome acts as an “intelligent envelope” that protects active ingredients, controls their release, and delivers them precisely to target cells—preventing premature degradation. PDRN is an organic DNA fragment (from salmon) that serves as “genetic spare parts,” helping rebuild damaged cells, promote angiogenesis, and reduce inflammation. When PDRN is encapsulated inside an exosome, it reaches the cell membrane directly and is absorbed with high biological efficiency. The result: a precise, targeted regenerative action that visibly improves skin elasticity, texture, and appearance—starting from the first session."
    },
    "item6": {
      "title": "What is unique about combining synthetic exosomes with biomimetic peptides?",
      "text": "Biomimetic peptides are lab-designed chains of amino acids that mimic natural growth factors in the body. However, when applied alone, many of them degrade quickly or fail to reach cellular receptors. Encapsulating them in synthetic exosomes changes everything: The exosome protects the peptide from early breakdown. It enables controlled, targeted delivery directly to the skin cells. It significantly enhances bioavailability—so a smaller dose delivers visible clinical effects. The result: increased collagen, elastin, and ECM production, reduced wrinkles, dermal repair, and a firmer, more youthful appearance—with maximum precision and minimal product."
